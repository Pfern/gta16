Self-description
I am a biostatistician working in the Computational Genomics Department of the Prince Felipe Research Center (CIPF) in Valencia,
where our goal is to apply translational bioinformatics to personalized medicine integrating genomic and clinical data. 
My main research interests:
- Statistical methods development for analysis and omic data integration from a Systems Biology perspective.
- Software development that allow converting data produced by the new high-throughput technologies (NGS, proteomics, metabolomics) into valuable, meaningful biomedical information that can be used for diagnostic, and prognostic purposes.
- Characterization of genetic variation in human populations by NGS.
